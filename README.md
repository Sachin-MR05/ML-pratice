Welcome to my Machine Learning practice repository! Here, I share my complete ML practice notes, the resources I used to learn machine learning, and the tasks I completed during my learning journey.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning is used to find patterns in existing data. These patterns can produce outputs for given inputs. With these patterns, we can predict outputs for new inputs.

### Example
Consider the task of summing numbers. Machine learning can learn from data and perform the sum every time you provide numbersâ€”whether two, three, or many numbers. In contrast, if explicitly programmed, you would need to write separate logic for summing two numbers, three numbers, and so on.

## ML vs DL

### ML
ML writes the rules for itself with the given data. It uses statistical tools.

**Example**  
If you give a lot of images, some of which are dogs and some are not, the machine writes the code rules itself to identify which is a dog.

### DL
Inspired by the human brain, we train a model to learn the data, similar to machine learning, but here we use nodes and layers. If the layers increase, the accuracy of the model increases.

### Conclusion

(Explicit programming (only suits for the particular scenario)) > (ML (can learn with data (features and target) on its own and work with different scenarios)) > (DL (creates features by its own to find the target))
