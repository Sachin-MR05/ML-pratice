Welcome to my Machine Learning practice repository! Here, I share my complete ML practice notes, the resources I used to learn machine learning, and the tasks I completed during my learning journey.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning is used to find patterns in existing data. These patterns can produce outputs for given inputs. With these patterns, we can predict outputs for new inputs.

## Example

Consider the task of summing numbers. Machine learning can learn from data and perform the sum every time you provide numbersâ€”whether two, three, or many numbers. In contrast, if explicitly programmed, you would need to write separate logic for summing two numbers, three numbers, and so on.
