- Finding which products sell more. By that, they easily find which ones they want to have more stock.
- Suggesting products based on searching and previous buying history.

## Supermarket
The supermarket gets the user's number and creates a profile. By that, they track the user's buying history and buying frequency.

## Correlation Between Products
Supermarkets use machine learning to analyze data and find correlations between two products. This means they can find which products are selling at the same time and place them near each other.

## Bank Loan Approval
The bank compares the customer's profile with previous scammers. If the matching is high, they do not provide the loan.

## Cab Driver Calculating the Cost
When there is high demand for cabs, the need is high. So, cab drivers come near surrounding areas. If the demand is very high, they come near districts and charge more. They can reach the spot after the user calls; they calculate the demand previously with data.
