# Important Processes

## Data Collection
- **Ready-made data**
  - We use our own dataset or download already collected datasets.
- **API**
  - Using APIs to gather data.
- **Web Scraping**
  - Getting data from websites like Google.

## Best Algorithm vs. Big Dataset
The model trained with a big dataset (e.g., 1000 data points) and a basic algorithm is better compared to a model with the best algorithm trained on a small dataset (e.g., 100 data points).

## Biased Data
If there is a competition between A and B, and we only get data from A supporters to predict the outcome, the prediction will be biased.

## Data Preprocessing
Removing unwanted data and merging similar data makes the model more efficient.

## Overfitting and Underfitting

**Overfitting:** The model tries to memorize the training data and does not generalize or understand the data well.

**Underfitted model:** The prediction is the same line whether the data fluctuation is high or low.
