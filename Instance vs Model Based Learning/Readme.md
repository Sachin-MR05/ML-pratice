# Learning Types of ML Models

## Instance-Based Learning
The model learns by memorizing the data. It predicts the output for new input based on the nearest points in the training data. It needs more storage.

**Example**
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)

## Model-Based Learning
The model learns by generalizing the content and understanding the concepts. It calculates the boundary between the data with a mathematical function. The output for new input is predicted based on which side of the boundary it lies. Training data is not required after training; the model can predict the output with the help of the boundary. It needs less storage to store the model.

**Examples**
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
